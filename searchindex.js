The commonly used log crate defines the following levels (ordered by increasing severity): trace debug info warning error It's a good idea to think of info as the default log level. Use it for, well, informative output. (Some applications that lean towards a more quiet output style might only show warnings and errors by default.)

In Rust, \"crashes\" are most often \"panics\" (i.e., \"controlled crashing\" in contrast to \"the operating system killed the process\"). By default, when a panic occurs, a \"panic handler\" will print some information to the console. For example, if you create a new binary project with cargo new --bin foo and replace the content of fn main with panic!(\"Hello World\") , you get this when you run your program: thread 'main' panicked at 'Hello, world!', src/main.rs:2:5\nnote: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace. This is useful information to you, the developer. (Surprise: the program crashed because of line 2 in your main.rs file). But for a user who doesn't even have access to the source code, this is not very valuable. In fact, it most likely is just confusing. That's why it's a good idea to add a custom panic handler, that provides a bit more end-user focussed output. One library that does just that is called human-panic . To add it to your CLI project, you import it and call the setup_panic!() macro at the beginning of your main function: use human_panic::setup_panic; fn main() { setup_panic!(); panic!(\"Hello world\")\n} This will now show a very friendly message, and tells the user what they can do: Well, this is embarrassing. foo had a problem and crashed.

Writing a program with a simple command line interface (CLI) is great a exercise for a beginner who is new to the language and wants to get a feel for it.

Look at grrs foobar test.txt : There are two arguments, first the pattern (the string to look for), and then the path (the file to look in). What more can we say about them? Well, for a start, both are required. We haven't talked about any default values, so we expect our users to always provide two values. Further more, we can say a bit about their types: The pattern is expected to be a string, while the second argument is expect to be path to a file. In Rust, it is very common to structure programs around the data they deal with so this way of looking at CLI arguments fits very well. Let's start with this: #[derive(Debug)]\nstruct Cli { pattern: String, path: std::path::PathBuf,\n} This defines a new structure (a struct ) that has two fields to store data in: pattern , and path . Aside: PathBuf is like a String but for file system paths that works cross-platform. Now, we still need to get the actual arguments our program got into this form. One option would be manually parse the list of strings we get from the operating system and build the structure ourselves. It would looks something like this: let pattern = std::env::args().nth(1).expect(\"no pattern given\");\nlet path = std::env::args().nth(2).expect(\"no path given\");\nlet args = Cli { pattern: pattern, path: std::path::PathBuf::from(path),\n}; This works, but it's not very convenient.

The most popular library for parsing command line arguments is called clap . It has all the functionality you'd expect, including support for sub-commands, shell completions, and great help messages. The structopt library builds on clap and provides a \"derive\" macro to generate clap applications. This is quite nice: All we have to do is annotate a struct and it’ll generate the code that parses the arguments into the fields. Let’s add our fields to the Cli struct in the template and also write some documentation comments along the way. It’ll look like this: #[macro_use] extern crate structopt;\nuse std::path::PathBuf;\nuse structopt::StructOpt; /// Search for a pattern in a file and display the lines that contain it.\n#[derive(StructOpt)]\nstruct Cli { /// The pattern to look for pattern: String, /// The path to the file to read #[structopt(parse(from_os_str))] path: std::path::PathBuf,\n} Note: There are a lot of custom attributes you can add to fields. For example, we added one to tell structopt how to parse the PathBuf type. To say you want to use this field for the argument after -o or --output , you'd add #[structopt(short = \"o\", long = \"output\")] . For more information, see the structopt documentation . TODO: Ensure this works with clap3. Issue #64 Right below the Cli struct our template contains its main function. When the program starts, it will call this function. The first line is: let args = Cli::from_args(); This will try to parse the arguments into our Cli struct. But what if that fails? That's the beauty of this approach: Clap knows which fields to expect, and what their expected format is. It can automatically generate a nice --help message, as well a give great errors to suggest you pass --output when you wrote --putput . Note: The from_args method is meant to be used in your main function. When it fails, it will print out an error or help message and exit the program.

Indeed, there was something hidden in our examples all this time: The function signature this code lives in. And in this last example with return , it becomes important.

This is why we can write return Err(error); in the second match arm. See how there is an Ok(()) at the bottom? It's the default return value of the function and means \"Result is okay, and has no content\". Aside: Why is this not written as return Ok(()); ? It easily could be – this is totally valid as well.

There are multiple ways to deal with this. For example, we can create our own error type, and then use that to build a custom error message: #[derive(Debug)]\nstruct CustomError(String); fn main() -> Result<(), CustomError> { let path = \"test.txt\"; let content = std::fs::read_to_string(path) .map_err(|err| CustomError(format!(\"Error reading `{}`: {}\", path, err)))?; println!(\"file content: {}\", content); Ok(())\n} Now, running this we'll get our custom error message: Error: CustomError(\"Error reading test.txt : No such file or directory (os error 2)\") Not very pretty, but we can easily adapt the debug output for our type later on. This pattern is in fact very common. It has one problem, though: We don't store the original error, only its string representation. The often used failure library has a neat solution for that: Similar to our CustomError type, it has a Context type that contains a description as well as the original error. The library also brings with it an extension trait ( ResultExt ) that adds context() and with_context() methods to Result . To turn these wrapped error types into something that humans will actually want to read, we can further add the exitfailure crate, and use its type as the return type of our main function.

But we've above seen that read_to_string returns a std::io::Error . This works because ? actually expands to code to convert error types. Box<dyn std::error::Error> is also an interesting type.

If your program needs to read that file and can't do anything if the file doesn't exist, exiting is a valid strategy.

You should be comfortable with using a command line/terminal. If you already know a few other languages, this can be a good first contact with Rust. Getting help: If you at any point feel overwhelmed or confused with the features used, have a look at the extensive official documentation that comes with Rust, first and foremost the book, The Rust Programming Language.

For example: let x = 42;\nprintln!(\"My lucky number is {}.\", x); will print My lucky number is 42. The curly braces ( {} ) in the string above is one of these placeholders.

What those commands are, and the types of machines they run on, is configurable. For example: A good idea is to run cargo test on a machine with Rust and some common build tools installed. If this fails, you know there are issues in the most recent changes. We can also use this to build binaries and upload them to Github! Indeed, if we run cargo build --release and upload the binary somewhere, we should be all set, right? Not quite. We still need to make sure the binaries we build are compatible with as many systems as possible. For example, on Linux we can compile not for the current system, but instead for the x86_64-unknown-linux-musl target, to not depend on default system libraries. On macOS, we can set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 10.7 to only depend on system features present in versions 10.7 and older. You can see one example of building binaries using this approach here for Linux and macOS and here for Windows (using AppVeyor). Another way is to use pre-built (Docker) images that contain all the tools we need to build binaries. This allows us to easily target more exotic platforms, too. The trust project contains scripts that you can include in your project as well as instructions on how to set this up. It also includes support for Windows using AppVeyor. If you'd rather set this up locally and generate the release files on your on machine, still have a look at trust.

It also works around two of the downsides we just saw for cargo install : There is no need to have Rust installed on the user's machine, and instead of it taking a minute to compile, they can instantly run the binary.

That can take a lot of time. At the same time, many people have come to enjoy telling computers to do things for them. Let's talk about how to automate these tests. Rust has a built-in test framework, so let's start by writing a first test: #[test]\nfn check_answer_validity() { assert_eq!(answer(), 42);\n} You can put this snippet of code in pretty much any file and cargo test will find and run it. The key here is the #[test] attribute. It allows the build system to discover such functions and run them as tests, verifying that they don't panic. Exercise for the reader: Make this test work. You should end up with output like the following: running 1 test\ntest check_answer_validity ... ok test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out Now that we've seen how we can write tests, we still need to figure out what to test. As you've seen it's fairly easy to write assertions for functions. But a CLI application is often more than one function! Worse, it often deals with user input, reads files, and writes output.","breadcrumbs":"A command line app in 15 minutes » Automated testing","id":"tutorial/testing.html#automated-testing","title":"Automated testing"},"tutorial/testing.html#making-your-code-testable":{"body":"There are two complementary approaches to testing functionality: Testing the small units that you build your complete application from, these are called \"unit tests\". There is also testing the final application \"from the outside\" called \"black box tests\" or \"integration tests\". Let's begin with the first one. To figure out what we should test, let's see what our program features are. Mainly, grrs is supposed to print out the lines that match a given pattern. So, let's write unit tests for exactly this : We want to ensure that our most important piece of logic works, and we want to do it in a way that is not dependent on any of the setup code we have around it (that deals with CLI arguments, for example). Going back to our first implementation of grrs , we added this block of code to the main function: // ...\nfor line in content.lines() { if line.contains(&args.pattern) { println!(\"{}\", line); }\n} Sadly, this is not very easy to test. First off all, it's in the main function, so we can't easily call it. This is easily fixed by moving this piece of code into a function: fn find_matches(content: &str, pattern: &str) { for line in content.lines() { if line.contains(pattern) { println!(\"{}\", line); } }\n} Now we can call this function in our test, and see what its output is: #[test]\nfn find_a_match() { find_matches(\"lorem ipsum\\ndolor sit amet\", \"lorem\"); assert_eq!( // uhhhh Or… can we? Right now, find_matches prints directly to stdout , i.e., the terminal. We can't easily capture this in a test! This is a problem that often comes up when writing tests after the implementation: We have written a function that is firmly integrated in the context it is used in. Note: This is totally fine when writing small CLI applications. There's no need to make everything testable! It is important to think about which parts of your code you might want to write unit tests for, however. While we'll see that it's easy to change this function to be testable, this is not always the case. Alright, how can we make this testable? We'll need to capture the output somehow. Rust's standard library has some neat abstractions for dealing with I/O (input/output) and we'll make use of one called std::io::Write . This is a trait that abstract over things we can write to, which includes strings but also stdout . Note: We could also make this function return a String , but that would change the behavior. Instead of writing to the terminal directly, it would then collect everything into a string, and dump all the results in one go at the end. Let's change our function to also accept a parameter writer that implements Write . In our test, we can then supply a simple string to make assertions on. Instead of println!(…) we can just use writeln!(writer, …) . fn find_matches<W: Write>(content: &str, pattern: &str, writer: &mut W) { for line in content.lines() { if line.contains(pattern) { writeln!(writer, \"{}\", line); } }\n} Now we can test for the output: #[test]\nfn find_a_match() { let mut result = Vec::new(); find_matches(\"lorem ipsum\\ndolor sit amet\", \"lorem\", &mut result); assert_eq!(result, b\"lorem ipsum\\n\");\n} To now use this in our application code, we have to change the call to find_matches in main by adding &mut std::io::stdout() as the third parameter. Note: Since stdout expects bytes (not strings), we use std::io::Write , instead of std::fmt::Write . As a result, we give an empty vector as \"writer\" in our tests (its type will be inferred to by Vec<u8> ), and in the assert_eq! we use a b\"foo\" instead of a regular string. Exercise for the reader: writeln! returns an io::Result . Add error handling to find_matches . We've just seen how to make this piece of code easily testable. We have identified one of the core pieces of our application, put it into its own function, and made it more flexible. Even though the goal was to make it testable, the result we ended up with is actually a very idiomatic and reusable piece of Rust code. That's awesome!","breadcrumbs":"A command line app in 15 minutes » Making your code testable","id":"tutorial/testing.html#making-your-code-testable","title":"Making your code testable"},"tutorial/testing.html#splitting-your-code-into-library-and-binary-targets":{"body":"There's one more step we can go here. So far we've put everything we wrote into the src/main.rs file. This means our current project produces a single binary. But we can also make our code available as a library, like this: Put the find_matches function into a new src/lib.rs . Add a pub in front of the fn (so it's pub fn find_matches ) to make it something that users of our library can access. Remove find_matches from src/main.rs , and instead add an extern crate grrs; on top. In the fn main , prepend the call to find_matches with grrs:: , so it's now grrs::find_matches(…) . This means it uses the function from the library we just wrote! The way Rust deals with projects is quite flexible and it's a good idea to think about what to put into the library part of your crate early on. You can for example think about writing a library for your application-specific logic first and then use it in your CLI just like any other library. Or, if your project has multiple binaries, you can put the common functionality into the library part of that crate. Note: Speaking of putting everything into a src/main.rs : If we can continue to do that, it'll become difficult to read. The module system can help you structure and organize your code.","breadcrumbs":"A command line app in 15 minutes » Splitting your code into library and binary targets","id":"tutorial/testing.html#splitting-your-code-into-library-and-binary-targets","title":"Splitting your code into library and binary targets"},"tutorial/testing.html#testing":{"body":"Over the decades of people doing software development one truth has been found: Untested software rarely works. (Many people would go so far and add \"Most tested software doesn't work either.\" But we are all optimists here, right?) So, to ensure that your program does what you expect it to do, it is wise to test it. One easy way to do that is to write a README file that describes what your program should do. And when you feel ready to make a new release, go through the README and ensure that the behavior is still as expected. You can make this a more rigorous exercise by also writing down how your program should react to erroneous inputs. Here's another fancy idea: Write that README before you write the code. Aside: Have a look at Test-driven development (TDD) if you haven't heard of it.","breadcrumbs":"A command line app in 15 minutes » Testing","id":"tutorial/testing.html#testing","title":"Testing"},"tutorial/testing.html#testing-cli-applications-by-running-them":{"body":"Thus far, we've gone out of our way to test the business logic of our application, which turned out to be the find_matches function. This is very valuable and is a great first step towards a well-tested code base. (Usually, these kinds of tests are called \"unit tests\".) There is a lot of code we aren't testing, though: Everything that we wrote to deal with the outside world! Imagine you wrote the main function, but accidentally left in a hard-coded string instead of using the argument of the user-supplied path. We should write tests for that, too! (This level of testing is often called \"integration testing\", or \"system testing\".) At its core, we are still writing functions and annotate them with #[test] . It's just a matter of what we do inside these functions. For example, we'll want to use the main binary of our project, and run it like a regular program. We will also put these tests into a new file in a new directory: tests/cli.rs . Aside: By convention, cargo will look for integration tests in the tests/ directory. Similarly, it will look for benchmarks in benches/ , and examples in examples /. These conventions also extend to your main source code: libraries have a src/lib.rs file, the main binary is src/main.rs , or, if there are multiple binaries, cargo expects them to be in src/bin/<name>.rs . Following these conventions will make your code base more discoverable by people used to reading Rust code. To recall, grrs is a small tool that searches for a string in a file. We have previously tested that we can find a match. Let's think about what other functionality we can test. Here is what I came up with. What happens when the file doesn't exist? What is the output when there is no match? Does our program exit with an error when we forget one (or both) arguments? These are all valid test cases. Additionally, we should also include one test case for the \"happy path\", i.e., we found at least one match and we print it. To make these kinds of tests easier, we're going to use the assert_cmd crate. It has a bunch of neat helpers that allow us to run our main binary and see how it behaves. Further, we'll also add the predicates crate which helps us write assertions that assert_cmd can test against (and that have great error messages). This sounds like a lot of setup. Nevertheless -- let's dive right in and create our tests/cli.rs file: extern crate assert_cmd;\nextern crate predicates; use std::process::Command; // Run programs\nuse assert_cmd::prelude::*; // Add methods on commands\nuse predicates::prelude::*; // Used for writing assertions #[test]\nfn file_doesnt_exist() -> Result<(), Box<std::error::Error>> { let mut cmd = Command::main_binary()?; cmd.arg(\"foobar\") .arg(\"test/file/doesnt/exist\"); cmd.assert() .failure() .stderr(predicate::str::contains(\"No such file or directory\")); Ok(())\n} You can run this test with cargo test , just the tests we wrote above. It might take a little longer the first time, as Command::main_binary() needs to compile your main binary. TODO: Talk about generating temp dirs with demo files. Write a useful test asserting clap's output (not to little, no too much; we don't want to test all of clap after all) Issue #72","breadcrumbs":"A command line app in 15 minutes » Testing CLI
